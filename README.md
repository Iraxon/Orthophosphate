# Orthophosphate

Orthophosphate (OPO4) is a domain-specific language and a compiler for that language, designed to facilitate the creation of Minecraft data packs. It is intended for data packs that change survival gameplay.

The Orthophosphate compiler has four passes: a lexer (tokenizer), a parser, a post-parser, and a generator. It follows the same architecture as modern compilers for general purpose languages.

## Using Orthophosphate

Orthophosphate is still under construction and not yet ready for use.

## Acknowledgements

- Orthophosphate would not have been made if not for the massive frustration, pain, and suffering involved in developing data packs manually with Notepad. That experience will not be missed.

- [The Super Tiny Compiler](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/the-super-tiny-compiler/tree/master) provided the understanding necessary to build the Orthophosphate compiler. Orthophosphate would not have been possible without it.
