/* Think of `core` as the Orthophosphate
equivalent of `main()`. It is conventional to
use exactly one core function that runs every tick as a single point
of entry. This makes it easier to control the order
that things get executed in. It is not, however,
enforced by Orthophosphate.

The "this:" namespace uses the file name
to generate a namespace. Use it for your datapack's
main namespace.
