/* Think of `core` as the Orthophosphate
equivalent of `main()`. It is conventional to
use exactly one core function that runs every tick as a single point
of entry. This makes it easier to control the order
that things get executed in. It is not, however,
enforced by Orthophosphate.

No namespace or the "this:" namespace are replaced
with the a namespace generated from the file name. Use
that for your data pack's main namespace. */
